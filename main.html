                <p style="grid-area: keterangan;">
                    British superstar Adele cried on Saturday night as she played her 100th and final show in Las Vegas.
                    She has spent the past two years playing a weekend residency at the 4,000-capacity Caesars Palace. 
                    Throughout her residency she often interacted with fans, but has indicated that the experience has been emotionally draining.
                    Videos from inside the venue on Saturday show Adele getting emotional during the concert and crying as she bid farewell to Vegas.
                    It began later that year, and she performed every Friday and Saturday.

                    His new album, Something to Give Each Other, he gets specific about aspects of queer life that don't often get a mainstream platform.
                    Sivan spoke with NPR's Ari Shapiro about designing Something to Give Each Other to be attuned to the details of queer love and attraction, and the small handful of listeners he still feels shy in front of.
